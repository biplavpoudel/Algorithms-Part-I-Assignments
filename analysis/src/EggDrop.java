// Suppose that you have an  n-story building (with floors 1 through n) and plenty of eggs.
// An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise.
// Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T
// given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

// Version 0: 1 egg, ≤ T tosses.
// Version 1: ∼ 1 lgn eggs and ∼ 1 lgn tosses.
// Version 2: ∼ lgT eggs and ∼ 2 lg T tosses.
// Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼ 2 * (square root of n) tosses.
// Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤ c * (square root of T) tosses for some fixed constant c.
